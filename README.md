# Classic Arcade Game

## How to Play


#### Basic Functionality

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved blocks. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

#### Key Controls
Users move the Player by using the up/right/left/down arrow keys on their keyboard.

| Right Key | Move player to the right 1 space |
| Up Key    | Move player up 1 space           |
| Down Key  | Move player down 1 space         |
